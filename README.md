# MVVM Architecture : 
       View   —     it  informs the ViewModel about the user’s actions
       ViewModel —  it exposes streams of data relevant to the View
       Model — it abstracts the data source. The ViewModel works with the DataModel to get and save the data

Library / android jetpacks Concepts  Used :

# 1.  Live Data : 
LiveData is an observable data holder class. LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments,   or services.

# 2. ViewModel:
ViewModel class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. 

# 3. Retrofit : 
Retrofit is a type-safe REST client for Android, Java and Kotlin developed by Square. The library provides a powerful framework for authenticating and interacting with APIs and sending network requests with OkHttp.

# 4. Glide :  
Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface. 

# Android Material design :
Material design is a comprehensive guide for visual, motion, and interaction design across platforms and devices. 
Recyclerview : The RecyclerView widget is a more advanced and flexible version of ListView.
    
#  Coroutines :
Coroutines are a great new feature of Kotlin which allow us  to write asynchronous code in a sequential fashion.
