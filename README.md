Library / Concepts  Used :

# 1. Coroutines : Coroutines are a great new feature of Kotlin which allow us  to write asynchronous code in a sequential fashion.

# 2.  Live Data : LiveData is an observable data holder class. LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments,   or services.

# 3.  MVVM Architecture : 
       View   —     it  informs the ViewModel about the user’s actions
       ViewModel —  it exposes streams of data relevant to the View
       Model — it abstracts the data source. The ViewModel works with the DataModel to get and save the data

# 4. Retrofit : Retrofit is a type-safe REST client for Android, Java and Kotlin developed by Square. The library provides a powerful framework for authenticating and interacting with APIs and sending network requests with OkHttp.

# 5. Android Material design : Material design is a comprehensive guide for visual, motion, and interaction design across platforms and devices. 
    Recyclerview : The RecyclerView widget is a more advanced and flexible version of ListView.
    
# 6. Glide :  Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
